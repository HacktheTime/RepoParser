# NEU repo parsing

A standalone library for parsing the [NEU repo](https://github.com/NotEnoughUpdates/NotEnoughUpdates-REPO/). Intended to
be used for NEU, but can also be used for other purposes.

## Versioning

Due to this library not having parity with the actual parser in the normal NEU mod, there will be rapid changes in
development. As such every commit could be a breaking change. Please plan accordingly for now.

## Licensing

This repository incorporates (in addition to libraries loaded by gradle) a file taken
from [the google gson extra repository](https://github.com/google/gson/blob/master/extras/src/main/java/com/google/gson/typeadapters/RuntimeTypeAdapterFactory.java)
with our own changes (highlighted in the code). That file is licensed under the Apache License version 2.0. The rest of
the source code is licensed under the BSD-3-Clause No Military License.
